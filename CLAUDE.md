# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Claude Code plugin that monitors per-IAM-user Amazon Bedrock API costs via CloudWatch Logs Insights and hard-blocks usage when a spending threshold is reached. Built entirely with Markdown, JSON, and Bash (no programming language code).

## Plugin Structure

## Config Architecture

Three config files, merged at runtime via `jq -s '.[0] * .[1]'`:

- **`config.json`** (shared base): pricing, log_group, default_*_per_1k — maintained once, used by everyone
- **`admin/config.admin.json`** (admin policy): threshold_usd, period, check_interval, timezone, progressive
- **`admin/config.dist.json`** (employee defaults): same fields, different values — merged with base during release

check-cost.sh merges base + admin at runtime. release.sh merges base + dist to produce the marketplace config.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Fail-open**: All errors → exit 0 (allow usage). Never block a developer due to infra issues. No `set -euo pipefail` in check-cost.sh.
- **Plugin hooks vs settings.json hooks**: Plugin `hooks.json` non-zero exit codes do NOT block sessions/prompts. Actual blocking requires `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks. Both are needed: plugin for commands/skills, settings.json for enforcement.
- **4-type token pricing**: Input, cache_read, cache_write, output each have separate per-model pricing. Cache read is ~10x cheaper than input.
- **ARN model ID extraction**: Bedrock logs `modelId` as inference profile ARN (`arn:aws:bedrock:.../us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`). Script extracts model ID and strips `us.` prefix for config.json pricing lookup.
- **Daily accumulation** (monthly period): Only queries today's logs, caches previous days' totals in a daily state file. Reduces CloudWatch scan cost ~31x. Weekly full-month reconciliation corrects drift.
- **Progressive checking**: Adaptive check intervals based on cost proximity to threshold. Low spend (<50%) → every 50 prompts; mid (50-80%) → every 20; high (>80%) → every 5.
- **Cross-platform**: Uses `awk` instead of `bc` for arithmetic, math-based epoch calculation instead of `date -d`. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows Git Bash/WSL.
- **Log group naming**: `aws/` prefix is reserved by AWS. Use `bedrock/model-invocations`.
- **Admin-only threshold**: `threshold_usd` is not user-modifiable via `/cost-config set`. Users can change `check_interval`, `period`, `timezone` only. Pricing and `log_group` require direct file edit.

## Exit Code Semantics (check-cost.sh)

- `exit 0` — allow usage (also used for all error/fail-open paths)
- `exit 2` — hard block (only when cost >= threshold, never in `report` mode)
- Blocking only works from `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks, not from plugin `hooks.json`

## Runtime State

- Counter: `/tmp/claude-cost-guardrail-${USER}-counter` (integer, resets each session)
- Cache: `/tmp/claude-cost-guardrail-${USER}-cache.json` (cost + timestamp, 5-min TTL)
- Daily state: `/tmp/claude-cost-guardrail-${USER}-daily.json` (monthly accumulation: finalized days + previous_total + reconciliation timestamp)
- Merged config: `/tmp/claude-cost-guardrail-${USER}-merged.json` (base + admin, regenerated each run)
- Cache bypass: `session_start` and `report` events always query CloudWatch fresh. Only `prompt_submit` uses cache.
- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` env var — set by Claude Code plugin loader, resolves to repo root (where `.claude-plugin/` lives). Used in hooks.json commands and command .md files.

## Testing

```bash
# Syntax check
bash -n hooks/check-cost.sh
bash -n hooks/lib-cost.sh

# Report mode (queries AWS, never blocks)
bash hooks/check-cost.sh --event report

# Validate JSON
find . -name "*.json" -not -path "./.git/*" -exec jq . {} \;

# Prerequisite check
bash scripts/preflight.sh

# Validate plugin
claude plugin validate .
```

## CloudWatch Query Details

- Filters by `identity.arn` and aggregates by `modelId`
- Token fields: `input.inputTokenCount`, `input.cacheReadInputTokenCount`, `input.cacheWriteInputTokenCount`, `output.outputTokenCount`
- Results parsed by field name (not positional index) for robustness against schema changes
- Model ID lookup chain: exact match in `pricing` → strip `us.` prefix and retry → fall back to `default_*_per_1k`
- Query polls with progressive backoff (2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3 = 25s max); on timeout falls back to cache, then fail-open
- Daily accumulation: normal queries scan only today's logs; weekly reconciliation scans full month

## config.json Pricing Format

```json
{
  "pricing": {
    "anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1": {
      "input_per_1k": 0.015,
      "output_per_1k": 0.075,
      "cache_read_per_1k": 0.0015,
      "cache_write_per_1k": 0.01875
    }
  }
}
```

Models not in pricing table use `default_*_per_1k` values. Pricing is manually maintained from Bedrock pricing page.

## Prerequisites

- Bedrock Model Invocation Logging enabled → CloudWatch Logs
- AWS CLI v2 with permissions: `logs:StartQuery`, `logs:GetQueryResults`, `sts:GetCallerIdentity`
- jq, awk installed (bc is NOT required)
- Run `bash scripts/preflight.sh` to verify all prerequisites

## Notes

- README.md is written in Korean. Keep it in Korean when editing.
- Design spec lives at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-19-cost-guardrail-plugin-design.md` — consult for architectural rationale.

## Repositories

- Source: https://github.com/gonsoomoon-ml/cost-guardrail-claude-code-bedrock
- Marketplace: https://github.com/gonsoomoon-ml/bedrock-cost-guardrail

## Release Workflow

To publish a new version to the marketplace repo:

    bash scripts/release.sh /path/to/bedrock-cost-guardrail
    cd /path/to/bedrock-cost-guardrail && git add -A && git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z" && git push

The release script merges `config.json` + `admin/config.dist.json` to produce the distribution config ($180 employee threshold).
